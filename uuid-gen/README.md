Beelink (and probably others) mini-PCs seem to not bother setting the UUID, resulting in all having the same generic UUID. This causes a problem for Omni, which relies on UUID for identifying nodes.

This will update all American Megatrends (AMI) BIOS to set the UUID to a random value.

Copy all files to a bootable USB stick and boot the mini-PC off it

Tested to work on Beelink U59 Pro and Mini S12 Pro

Use at your own risk.
